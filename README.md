# Hangman - java console game

This short program is the first program I have ever created in Java. It is a very simple hangman game played on the console.

To run the program:
1. compile with: javac Hangman.java
2. run with: java Hangman

You can only play the game once per run. To play again, you must re-run the java Hangman command.
